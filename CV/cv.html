          analysis, visualisation and machine learning.
          Answered questions on household access to green space

        <i>Group project used data from Public Health Scotland.
          This project answered questions including "Is winter crisis real?"
          and "Impact of covid" in the form of an interactive dashboard. The main package used
          R Shiny to produce the dashboard. The team worked collaboratively using an interactive
          Trello board to assign tasks and create work plans.
          I was in charge of data cleaning for this project.
          We explored 12 data sets and created draft graphs using ggplot2 the drafts
          were used to design the dashboard layout.</i>

        <i>This project used data from CitiBike. It answered business questions and provided visualisations.
          It worked with time series data and created spacial graphs too.
          Reports and presentation were presented at the end with action insights suggested by data.
          I used Leaflet to present spacial graphs, and ggplot2 to create statistic graphs.
          I provided trends for each week/weekday/month for different demographics.
          I did a lot of exploring with the data and created many draft graphs to
          pick out most valuable ones to answer the questions.</i>
