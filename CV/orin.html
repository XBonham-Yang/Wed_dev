    <h1>Orin</h1>
    <p><strong>DOB: 19 Apr 2022 </strong></p>
    <i>Orin is a ginger boy. He was born in Edinburgh. He came to our home at
    age 11 weeks old. He is a really sweet boy. He loves to play with tents and mice.
    He is very shy, he will run under the bed when the door bell rings.
    He also likes to look after his sister. When he first arrived, he was just a
    tiny kitten while Peggy was already 6 month old. He still licks her and made
    sure that she is clean. He taught Peggy a lot of kitten games and quickly built
    good relationship with her. When it's cold, he will snuggle with Peggy in their
    warm space.</i>
